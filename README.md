# 🎶 Audio Classification Project: UrbanSound8K 🎧
Welcome to the Audio Classification Project! This project classifies urban sounds into various categories using machine learning, making it ideal for real-world applications like smart city monitoring, audio recognition systems, and noise pollution analysis.


## 🌟 Project Overview
In this project, we leverage advanced audio processing techniques to classify sounds like dog barks, car horns, sirens, and much more from the UrbanSound8K dataset.

## Key Features:
##### 🎵 Sound Classification:
Classifies urban sounds into 10 categories (e.g., street music, air conditioners, jackhammers, etc.).
##### 🔊 Dataset:
10,000 labeled audio clips from urban environments.
##### 🤖 Machine Learning:
Uses feature extraction and classification algorithms to achieve accurate results.
##### 📊 Visualization: 
Visualize audio features and classification results with Matplotlib.
### ⚙️ Technologies Used
Librosa – Audio processing and feature extraction library.

Matplotlib – Visualizing the features of the audio signals.

IPython – For seamless audio playback in Jupyter notebooks.

UrbanSound8K Dataset – A popular dataset of urban sounds.

### 📸 Features & Visualizations
Multi-Class Dataset: Urban sounds classified into categories like street music, drilling, gunshots, and more!

Data Visualization: Spectrograms, waveforms, and feature visualizations to understand the data.

### Objectives:

1:- Classify Urban Sounds: Develop a machine learning model to classify diverse urban sounds (e.g., dog barks, car horns, sirens) into predefined categories.

2:- Feature Extraction and Preprocessing: Implement effective preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to enhance model accuracy.

3:- Model Training and Evaluation: Train a machine learning model using the UrbanSound8K dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying urban sounds.

4:-Visualization: Visualize audio features such as spectrograms and waveforms to understand their impact on classification.

5:- Real-World Applications: Demonstrate the potential applications of the model in smart city monitoring, noise pollution analysis, and security systems.
